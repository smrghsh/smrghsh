# `"hello world!"`
I'm a VR researcher focused on the human computer interaction of multi-user scientific and engineering interfaces. I work out of the [SET Lab](https://setlab.soe.ucsc.edu/) as PhD student at UC Santa Cruz where I'm practicing design research and validation. ðŸŒŠðŸŒ² 

I specialize in WebXR development and [three.js](https://threejs.org/) applications especially those that involve 3D interfaces, networking code, and scalability.

I owe a lot to creative code communities, such as the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) community for mentorship and profound creative inspiration, the Google Summer of Code program for teaching me how to contribute, and the creative code collective for opportunities to organize and support. 

Before my current position, I worked at the [Ahmanson Lab](https://polymathic.usc.edu/ahmanson-lab) where I managed a makerspace and produced AR and VR technologies for the humanities-- coordinating and contributing to game engine, web, and mobile development teams.

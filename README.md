# `hello world!`
My name is Samir (any pronouns), and I am a researcher of VR interfaces, currently focusing on multi-user environments for scientific and engineering simulations. I work out of the [SET Lab](https://setlab.soe.ucsc.edu/news.php) at beautiful UC Santa Cruz. ðŸ¤™ðŸŒŠðŸŒ² 

I specialize in WebXR based development including [Mozilla Hubs](https://hubs.mozilla.com/) integration, custom [three.js](https://threejs.org/) development. As an educator and artist, I owe a lot of technical acumen to the teachers from the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) community and mentorship through [p5.xr](https://github.com/stalgiag/p5.xr) contributions during [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).

Before my current position, I worked at the [Ahmanson Lab](https://polymathic.usc.edu/ahmanson-lab) where I managed a makerspace and protyped experimental AR and VR technologies for the humanities.

# `hello world!`
I'm a VR researcher focused on the human computer interaction of multi-user scientific and engineering interfaces. I work out of the [SET Lab](https://setlab.soe.ucsc.edu/) as PhD student at UC Santa Cruz where I'm practicing design research and validation. ðŸŒŠðŸŒ² 

I specialize in WebXR development and [three.js](https://threejs.org/) applications especially those that involve 3D interfaces, networking code, and scalability.

I owe a lot to creative code communities, such as the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) community for mentorship, the Google Summer of Code program, and support from the creative code collective. 

Before my current position, I worked at the [Ahmanson Lab](https://polymathic.usc.edu/ahmanson-lab) where I managed a makerspace and produced AR and VR technologies for the humanities-- coordinating and contributing to game engine, web, and mobile development teams.

Feel free to send an email or reach out on socials about this topic.

Santa Cruz community residents, please reach out about local creative code collective meetup.

I use web-browser and `javascript` based tools for creative code, WebXR development, and VR content. Sometimes, I use AI-based tools, demoscene strategies, engines, or 3D modeling softwares. Currently, I'm pursuing a PhD and researching multi-user VR software at the [SET Lab](https://setlab.soe.ucsc.edu/news.php) at UC Santa Cruz, advised by Katherine Isbister.

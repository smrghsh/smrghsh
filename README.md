# `hello world!`
My name is Samir Ghosh (any pronouns), and I'm a VR researcher. Currently I'm building multi-user scientific and engineering simulations. I work out of the [SET Lab](https://setlab.soe.ucsc.edu/) at beautiful UC Santa Cruz. ðŸŒŠðŸŒ² 

I specialize in WebXR development such as [Mozilla Hubs](https://hubs.mozilla.com/) integration and custom [three.js](https://threejs.org/) applications. WebGL, WebXR, and WebRTC and their related technologies inform my work. For my creative and pedagogical practices, I owe a lot to creative code communities, such as teachings from professors, artists, and coders from the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) community, and support from the creative code collective.

Before my current position, I worked at the [Ahmanson Lab](https://polymathic.usc.edu/ahmanson-lab) where I managed a makerspace and produced AR and VR technologies for the humanities-- coordinating and contributing to game engine, web, and mobile development teams.
